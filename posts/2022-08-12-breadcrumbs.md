I got my **ServiceNow Certified System Administrator** certification last week! ðŸ¥³

With all the reviewing out of the way, I can get to doing other stuff.

Some quick updates to this site:

 - Fixed the profile image so that it doesn't distort when resizing the browser. Check out the Next.js documentation about the next/image component [here](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/next/image). I added a parent element to the image and used `layout='fill'`.
 - Created a breadcrumb component so the blog post entries have backlinks to the blog.

You can check out the source code over at GitHub: [eumali22/nextjs-blog](https://github.com/eumali22/nextjs-blog).

 That's it for now!
