Quick update: I edited this site and added a new (temporary) layout to make it look a bit more alive.
All the other pages are still under construction though!

I am also learning how to add images to markdown files, so here's a sweet one:
![Golden hour image](/images/lubang_mindoro_golden_hour.jpg "Lubang, Mindoro golden hour")

Cheers!
