Hello World! ðŸ¤–

So today, I decided to open Visual Studio Code and add an entry to this blog:

 - Added my profile picture from LinkedIn
 - Tried out Google Fonts

A lot of stuff going on at the moment. The usual 9-5, a ServiceNow certification exam this coming weekend, and
a Laravel freelance project. Feeling productive so all good!

See you later! Cheers!
